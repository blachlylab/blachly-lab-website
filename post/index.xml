      <description>James Blachly, MD, assistant professor of Internal Medicine and Biomedical Informatics at the Ohio State Comprehensive Cancer Center, discusses the role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for patients with hairy cell leukemia.
Blachly says ctDNA is an important emerging biomarker in many different cancer types, as well as non-cancer applications. However, this has not been tested previously in hairy cell leukemia. This disease behaves like any other non-Hodgkin lymphoma and sheds a moderate amount of cell free DNA that is readily detectable.</description>
